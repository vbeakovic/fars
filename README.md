# R Package for exploring NHTSA's FARS data

NHTSA - US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
FARS - Fatality Analysis Reporting System

The package cointains data and functions to explore data about fatal injuries suffered in motor veichle trafic crashes.
It was developed as an assignment to complete the "Building R Packages" course that is part of the Mastering Software Development in R (a JHU specialization on Coursera).



The goal of the README.md is to answer the following questions about your package:

    Why should I use it?
    How do I use it?
    How do I get it?

On GitHub, the README.md will be rendered as HTML and displayed on the repository home page.

I normally structure my README as follows:

    A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.

    An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.

    Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.

    An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.
